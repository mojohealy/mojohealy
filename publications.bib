  abstract = {As university graduates face increasingly changing and challenging labour markets and work environments, universities are prioritising the work of helping students develop their graduate employability. As a result, university Career Services and career development practitioners are subject to changing strategic and operational approaches to the provision of careers and employability learning opportunities at institution-wide scale. In this study, we examine current conceptualisations of careers and employability practice through the analysis of three sources of data: programdescriptions of postgraduate career development qualifications, position descriptions for careers and employability jobs advertised in Australia over the past four years, and focus groups with career development practitioners. Weevaluate how well existing career development qualifications align with the work of contemporary university career development practitioners, and identify opportunities to continue evolving the profession, to better help our students meet the demands of future life and work.},

  abstract = {``You've been doing employability the wrong way'' would be the click-bait headline if this chapter were to be published in an online news website. The prevailing approach to promoting graduate employability taken by higher education around the world is focused on the development of human capital, that is, work-related skills and knowledge (Clarke, 2017). However, graduate employability frameworks and strategies often overlook significant dispositional and contextual factors that contribute towards a person's employability. To more adequately promote the development of graduate employability, universities need to do more to connect students to their extensive networks of alumni and industry and provide careers and employability learning that helps students learn to explore and express their emerging professional identities (Bridgstock, 2017). In this chapter we will explore the approach taken within one Australian university to enhance the employability of life science students through embedding into the curriculum a careers and employability learning module that uses social media, specifically LinkedIn, as a pedagogical tool to develop students' career identity and connect them with professional networks.},

  abstract = {There is a growing interest in connecting the literature on graduate employability, career development, and worker employability. However, inconsistent terminology across these fields poses a challenge. This essay focuses on the term `school-to-work transition'. In career development and worker employability literature, it often refers to the movement from all stages of schooling into the labour market, while in graduate employability literature it is understood to only refer to the transition from secondary school into the labour market. To illustrate this issue, we use a metaphor comparing grapes to wine. Consequently, we propose `education-to-work transition' as an overarching term, with various subcategories specific to secondary and tertiary education.},

  abstract = {Purpose Professional networks are conduits for career insight, vehicles for career exploration and incubators of professional identity. Accordingly, LinkedIn is a rich environment for university students' careers and employability learning. In this article, the authors review how the pedagogical use of LinkedIn has been conceived, implemented and evaluated in higher education research. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a scoping literature review on research articles and chapters investigating the use of LinkedIn for careers and employability learning. The authors conducted a systematic database search and screened the results, resulting in 30 eligible studies. Each study was analysed for research characteristics, theoretical foundations, reported affordances or outcomes and critical concerns. Findings The authors find little evidence of cohesion or consistency in the existing research. Studies draw on different theoretical and methodological approaches and use different measures of networking behaviours and competencies. Studies tend not to consider ethical concerns about using LinkedIn as a pedagogical tool. Practical implications The authors argue this is not yet a body of research that supports the synthesis necessary for a reliable evidence base. The authors recommend that educators employing LinkedIn in the curriculum ground their work in more coherent, cohesive and integrated theories of careers and employability learning. Originality/value This review summarises a body of literature on the use of LinkedIn as a pedagogical tool for careers and employability learning in higher education. This review describes and critiques the beginnings of an evidence-base from which educators can further investigate how students can be supported to develop their online professional networking skills.},

  abstract = {Higher education students provide many reasons for their taking a particular degree. These typically relate to their current vocational interests and future employment prospects. This is significant since students' vocational identities and consequent decisions develop in a complex dynamic of vocational personality, characteristic adaptations, and life stories, all interacting with affordances in the social, economic, and cultural contexts of students' lives. Using contemporary personality theory and vocational psychology theory, we focus on the third dynamism---life stories---to explicate a method that facilitates assessment for and of learning in the context of career. Here we describe the conceptual and methodological dimensions of ``My Career Chapter---A Dialogical Autobiography'' (McIlveen, 2006) as an exemplar of an innovative pedagogical method with its conceptual foundations in vocational psychology and the theory of dialogical self. We will describe examples of its application in postgraduate studies and elaborate on its teaching and assessment affordances for career education. Finally, we will outline practical implications for the continuing application and evaluation of My Career Chapter, and the curricular vision that drives it, in higher education and career development learning.},

MCC leads the client through a reflective writing process based on their internal dialogues about their career and helps the client to edit the resulting manuscript into a productive and empowering narrative.
