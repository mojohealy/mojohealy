Early in May 2021, I had the honour of presenting my recent research into graduate employability as part of the [Centre for Global Higher Education](https://www.researchcghe.org/) seminar series.
The series, introduced by Professor Simon Marginson, is a fantastic resource that offers insight into a diverse spectrum of higher education research.
I presented to an audience of about 80 or so and enjoyed several thought provoking questions at the end.
You can watch the recording below.
