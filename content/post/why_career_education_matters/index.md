_This article was originally published on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-careers-employability-learning-matters-higher-education-healy/). It is a summary of some of the key research that supports the important role that careers and employability learn plays in higher education._ 

About three years ago I wrote an article summarising my research into the [evidence base of and best practices in careers and employability learning](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-best-practice-careers-education-outline-evidence-michael-healy/). 
I was pleased to see the warm response it got from my peers. 
Career development educators appreciated how I provided them with a clear, evidence-based argument of the contribution they make to their clients' education and careers. 
Many have drawn on that evidence as they prepare proposals, report on their work, and in some cases, justify their roles. 

Since then, I have continued to advocate for the value of career development theory, evidence, and practice. 
In this article I will share a little more of what I've learned from the literature about how university students benefit from quality higher education careers and employability learning. 

## What careers and employability learning can do for students
Several meta-analytic studies of career development interventions have shown that quality careers and employability learning has a positive impact on clients' career decision making self efficacy, decidedness, career maturity, career adaptability, and sense of vocational identity, among other things (Langher et al., 2018; Ozlem, 2019; Whiston et al., 2017). 

Studies which evaluate careers and employability courses for university students have found positive impacts on both career and academic outcomes, including adjustment to university, retention, completion, and achievement (Clayton et al., 2019; Hansen & Pederson, 2012; Reardon & Fiore, 2014; Reardon et al., 2015). 

Research into job search skills and success has shown that interventions designed to teach people how to search and apply for jobs significantly increase clients' self-efficacy and employment outcomes (Liu et al., 2014). 
Other meta-analytic research has demonstrated the importance of job search self-efficacy in achieving successful outcomes (van Hooft et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2019). 
Crucially, the clarity of a person's goals and the quality of their job search, both of which are stock in trade for career development educators, predict not only job search success, but also the _quality_ of the employment they secure (van Hooft et al., 2020).

Finally, research has shown that targeted education can improve entrepreneurial self-efficacy, intentions, and attitudes (Nabi et al., 2017) and networking behaviours and connections (Brown et al., 2019; Jokisaari & Vuori, 2011; Spurk et al., 2015), both of which contribute to university students' career success. 

## What quality careers and employability learning looks like
I've written before on the [career education evidence base](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-best-practice-careers-education-outline-evidence-michael-healy/), my [curricular vision for careers and employability learning](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-curricular-vision-careers-employability-learning-michael-healy/), and in particular, [dialogical approaches](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dialogical-approaches-careers-employability-learning-michael-healy/) that hold a lot of promise. 
In summary, there is support for the effectiveness of:

* repeated interventions, facilitated by a career development expert, delivered to groups (Brown & Ryan Krane, 2000; Whiston et al., 2017)
* targeting specific student needs and applying appropriate theories in a rigorous fashion (Langher et al., 2018; Whiston & James, 2013)
* certain critical ingredients of career interventions: written exercises, individual feedback, a strong working alliance between educator and student, labour market information and world of work exploration, mentoring and social support, values clarification, and psychoeducation (Brown & Ryan Krane, 2000; Langher et al., 2018; Whiston et al., 2017)

In addition, it's important to note an approach that is not currently supported by any evidence: computer based interventions without the moderation of a career development educator (Whiston et al., 2017).

## How to use this body of evidence
The evidence is clear: the work of career development educators has a positive impact on student outcomes. 
These citations can certainly support any argument you put forward to advocate for the role of career development education at your university. 
But by themselves, they are not enough.

In my experience, the academics and executives that career development educators find themselves trying to convince are not going to be swayed by a few research papers. 
What they want to know is how your programs and services improve the outcomes of their students. 
So it's vital that you draw on this existing research to design your own rigorous evaluations, rather than just sprinkle a few citations through your proposals and reports.

You need to show that your professional expertise has a real and measurable impact on the students you work with. 
Assess the outcomes of your programs with valid and reliable measures. 
Collect stories about student experiences of your programs to enrich your measurements with qualitative data. 
Most importantly, be curious about how your decisions as an educator impact what the student learns.

We have an abundance of evidence here at our fingertips, but we need to learn how to better use it to design and evaluate high quality quality careers and employability support for our students.
