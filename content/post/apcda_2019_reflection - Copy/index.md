I’ve been intending to write this article for some time, long before COVID19 sent the world into chaos. 
I’m now on my second day of work from home and trying to settle into a new kind of normal, which seems like it’s going to be with us for some time. 

Dan John is a fitness coach, but one with a difference. 
He works with pro footballers and special forces soldiers, but he also offers up fantastic fitness advice for [average folk](http://danjohn.net/2012/05/training-for-middle-age-and-beyond/). 
In a world of bravado and bombast, Dan John offers [refreshingly reasonable advice](http://danjohn.net/2011/06/even-easier-strength-perform-better-notes/) on how to build and maintain strength and physical fitness. 
One Dan John’s concepts has been particularly useful for me, not only in my fitness but also in helping me find balance and maintain perspective as I [juggle work, study, and family](https://mojohealy.com/post/me_myself_and_i/). 

Dan John describes two kinds of fitness regime: [the bus bench and the park bench](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19533819/bus-bench-program/). 
On the bus bench, you have clear expectations of what success looks like. 
Your aim is to be at the same bus stop at the same time, every day.
If you miss the bus, your day is ruined. 
Athletes preparing for a big competition are on the bus bench. 
They know what they want to achieve, when they want to achieve it, and every step they need to take to get there. 

On the park bench, on the other hand, you’re not waiting for anything. 
You have no specific expectations and time doesn’t matter much at all. 
Some things might be the same as yesterday, but if they’re not you’re not terribly concerned. 
You may not even be at the same park bench from day to day. 
Dan John argues that for most people’s fitness needs, a park bench program of moderate, varied exercise is more effective, more sustainable, and better for us than a bus bench workout. 

In the last couple of years I’ve tried to apply similar bus bench and park bench thinking to my PhD and professional work. 
Sometimes I have a firm deadline and a key deliverable, like a report due to my boss, a manuscript draft due to an editor, or an ethics application. 
I need to be clear on my goals, develop strategies for getting the work done, and apply self-discipline to manage my time and attention. 
Being on the bus bench to often or for too long is incredibly stressful and exhausting, especially when working to someone else’s timetable. 

I have come to recognise the importance of finding time for some time on the intellectual and professional park bench. 
Reading out of curiosity, around the boundaries of my work, or re-visiting things I read a long time ago. 
Keeping a journal, writing reading notes, jotting random ideas down, putting down [fat outlines](https://withoutbullshit.com/blog/fat-outline). 
Playing with a new tool or experimenting with a new method. 
Casual chats with friends and colleagues, or sitting in the campus coffee shop and seeing who happens by. 

Without being to romantic about it, the park bench is where you might make connections you didn’t notice when you were full of anxious energy at the bus stop. 
Where you have time to pursue an avenue of thought that you know has promise but isn’t immediately important (though often it actually is).
Where you are, put simply, more relaxed and more receptive to deep thought. 

Of course, there’s a thin line between the park bench and procrastination. 
It took me some time to calibrate where that line sits with me, but I’m getting there. 
I find myself revisiting Dan John’s articles on the bus bench and park bench and reflecting on where I need to be now and into the future. 

The bus bench is where many of us need to be as we plan and prepare for this serious global disruption. 
We’re trying to look after our families and communities but also to transition into a new way of working. 
Many are using the phrase “business as usual” but really, the current situation is anything but. 
We need to remind ourselves that a missed bus or two is, under the circumstances, entirely understandable. 
The stress this causes _will_ take a toll on our mental and physical health which will only get worse as time drags on. 

We need to make time for ourselves and those around us to spend some time on the park bench during all this, especially if we are in leadership positions where we can influence the schedule others are trying to work to. 
Look after yourself and those around you. Let your colleagues and students know that you care about their health and wellbeing more than you do about the details of their work.
