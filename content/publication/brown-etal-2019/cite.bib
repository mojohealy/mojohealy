 abstract = {“You’ve been doing employability the wrong way” would be the click-bait
headline if this chapter were to be published in an online news website. The
prevailing approach to promoting graduate employability taken by higher
education around the world is focused on the development of human capital,
that is, work-related skills and knowledge (Clarke, 2017). However, graduate
employability frameworks and strategies often overlook significant dispositional
and contextual factors that contribute towards a person’s employability.
To more adequately promote the development of graduate employability,
universities need to do more to connect students to their extensive networks of
alumni and industry and provide careers and employability learning that helps
students learn to explore and express their emerging professional identities
(Bridgstock, 2017).
In this chapter we will explore the approach taken within one Australian university
to enhance the employability of life science students through embedding
into the curriculum a careers and employability learning module that uses
social media, specifically LinkedIn, as a pedagogical tool to develop students’
career identity and connect them with professional networks.},
