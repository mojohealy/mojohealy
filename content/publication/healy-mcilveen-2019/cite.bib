 abstract = {My Career Chapter: a Dialogical Autobiography (MCC; McIlveen; 2015) is a qualitative career assessment and counselling tool based on the systems theory framework (STF; Patton & McMahon, 2014) and dialogical self theory (DST; Meijers & Hermans, 2017). MCC leads the client through a reflective writing process based on their internal dialogues about their career and helps the client to edit the resulting manuscript into a productive and empowering narrative. MCC’s theoretically informed practical features may be used to develop the reflective capacity of the client beyond the end of the counselling event, promoting lifelong learning, informed self-judgment, and improved self-regulation. This chapter describes the theoretical foundations of MCC and its application in a case vignette.},
