abstract: Providers, industry, and governments have embraced microcredentialing as a solution to the volatility and velocity of changes in labour markets, workplace competencies, and the needs of the 21st century lifelong learner. However, microcredentials do not, in and of themselves, guarantee career or employment success. Seeking a microcredential is one adaptive career behaviour that people might enact in pursuit of their career goals. Similarly, holding a microcredential is one form of employability capital that people might highlight when seeking employment. In this article, I argue that career development practitioners have a crucial role to play in helping learners approach microcredentials as part of a cohesive career strategy, integrate them into their career narratives, and express their value to employers.
