 abstract = {As university graduates face increasingly changing and challenging
labour markets and work environments, universities are prioritising
the work of helping students develop their graduate employability.
As a result, university Career Services and career development practitioners
are subject to changing strategic and operational approaches
to the provision of careers and employability learning opportunities
at institution-wide scale. In this study, we examine current conceptualisations
of careers and employability practice through the analysis
of three sources of data: programdescriptions of postgraduate career
development qualifications, position descriptions for careers and
employability jobs advertised in Australia over the past four years,
and focus groups with career development practitioners. Weevaluate
how well existing career development qualifications align with the work of contemporary university career development practitioners,
and identify opportunities to continue evolving the profession, to
better help our students meet the demands of future life and work.},
