abstract: "Career assessment is inherent in the professional practices of career development. Career assessment has its scientific, technical, and aesthetic foundations in applied psychology and education. It takes the forms of objective or subjective observation of another—a student or client—or reflectively of self. Assessment enables the practitioner, researcher, client, and student to conceptualize behaviour essential to performing acts of career development, such as identifying vocational interests, decision-making, and making meaning in diverse contexts of education and work. Its utility in higher education is demonstrated by examples of qualitative and quantitative methods of career assessment focused on employability. Considerations are given to the future potential and limitations of career assessment."
