summary: "A brief summary to the results of two of my PhD projects looking at careers and employability in higher education."
abstract: "Researchers and professionals in two distinct fields share a primary concern with how university graduates achieve employment and career success: graduate employability and career development. However, despite their shared interests, dialogue between these two scholarly and professional fields is limited. In this talk, I share some results from two studies into this problem. First, I share visualisations of academic research networks that illustrate the gap between the fields, but also highlight areas where some dialogue is emerging. Second, I  share results from a study of 401 careers and employability job advertisements in Australian higher education, which reveal significant differences between the career development professional and a diverse range of employability roles. My goal is to illustrate some of the complexities of the higher education careers and employability space and argue for more integrated, collaborative approaches."
