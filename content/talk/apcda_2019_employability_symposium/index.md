abstract: "What is employability? Is employability an affordance of social and economic contexts? Is employability a statistical index of the job market? Is employability a personal asset owned and managed by an individual? Whatever it is, employability certainly is a contested notion for scholars, practitioners, and policy experts. This symposium by the multidisciplinary research team ACCELL includes theoretical, empirical, and practical perspectives on employability. We present new evidence about employabilityâ€™s conceptualization and measurement in studies conducted in Australia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, and empirical evidence of the contribution of dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations, and narratives to employability. Presenters- Peter McIlveen,Carolyn Alchin, Jason Brown, Allison Creed, Michael Healy, Chris Kossen, Jennifer Luke, Tessa McCredie."
