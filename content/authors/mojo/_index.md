I am a careers and employability educator and researcher at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. I lead the development of a range of careers and employability services and programs and collaborate with academic staff to integrate careers and employability learning into the curriculum. 

I am pursuing a PhD in careers and employability learning in higher education. In addition to evaluating a dialogical approach to careers and employability learning, my research will be a record of my reflective practice as I seek to innovate in my profession.
