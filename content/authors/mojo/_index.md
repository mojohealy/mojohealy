I am a careers and employability educator and researcher. I collaborate with academic staff to integrate careers and employability learning into or alongside their curriculum. I get the greatest satisfaction from developing and delivering high-quality learning experiences, particularly using online, blended, and social learning approaches.

I am pursuing a PhD in careers and employability learning in higher education. In addition to evaluating a dialogical approach to careers and employability learning, my research will be a record of my reflective practice as I seek to innovate in my profession.
