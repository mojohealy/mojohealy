I am the National Manager, Career Education for myfuture.edu.au, Australia's national career education platform. Prior to this role I led the career development training programs from careerED Academy. I have also been a careers and employability educator at several universities, leading the development of a range of services and programs in and alongside the curriculum and contributing to the development of institution-wide career, employability, and work-integrated learning strategies and frameworks.  I am recognised as a leader in the field of career development and employability. 

I hold a PhD in careers and employability learning and my research has been published in leading international journals and edited collections.
