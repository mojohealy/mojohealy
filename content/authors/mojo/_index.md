I am Head of Careers and Employability at Career Ahead, where I lead the delivery of the Graduate Certificate and Diploma of Career Development offered in partnership with James Cook University. Prior to this role I have been a careers and employability educator at several universities, leading the development of a range of services and programs in and alongside the curriculum and contributing to the development of institution-wide career, employability, and work-integrated learning strategies and frameworks.  I am recognised as a leader in the field of career development and employability. 

I am soon to complete a PhD in careers and employability learning.  In addition to mapping the scholarly literature in the field and evaluating a dialogical approach to careers and employability learning, my research will be a record of my reflective practice as I seek to innovate in my profession. I am dedicated to innovation, data-driven continuous improvement, and working from a robust evidence-base.
